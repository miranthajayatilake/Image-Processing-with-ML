# Image Processing using ML - Simple guide 
<b>This repository contains some basic examples of using ML in Image processing. The notebooks present implementation of Dense Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks using Keras library.</b>

This is still very much work in progress. Hope to improve the contents as going forward.
